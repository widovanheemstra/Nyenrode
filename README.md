# README
This folder contains files that are part of the Hands-on Lab used in the Prototyping and Data Analysis session of the Nyenrode Big Data Essential course. In this lab a basic recommender engine is build to get a sense of how data products look like.

The recommender systems are created in Jupyter Notebooks and can be found in the notebook folder. Additional there is a notebook to get one familiar with pandas, one of the main libraries used in data analysis.

The code is by no means meant to run in production environments and is for demonstration purpose only.
